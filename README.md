# DiceChallengeGame

The **Dice Challenge Game** is a two-player game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can compete by rolling two dice, and the winner is determined based on the outcome of the dice rolls. The game provides an interactive and engaging experience, keeping track of the rounds won by each player and displaying the result on the screen.

In this game, players take turns rolling two dice and compete to have the higher number. The game screen consists of a "Throw Dice" button and a result area to display the outcome.

When a player clicks on the "Throw Dice" button, the JavaScript code generates random numbers between 1 and 6 for both dice. The numbers rolled on the dice are then compared, and the player with the higher number wins the round. If both dice roll the same number, it results in a draw.

The game displays the result on the screen. Player 1 starts by clicking the button, and then Player 2 can take their turn. The game continues until the players decide to stop. The use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows for an interactive and engaging gaming experience, providing real-time updates and visual feedback as players compete to claim victory in each round.

Throughout the game, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to provide an enjoyable gaming experience, with visual elements, interactivity, and real-time result updates.

#### Note: The Dice Challenge Game can be further enhanced with additional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features, such as animations, sound effects, or a more sophisticated scoring system. The use of these technologies makes the game interactive and dynamic, adding to the overall enjoyment of the gameplay.
